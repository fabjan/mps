## Mosh Paper Scissors

MPS is a massively multiplayer rock paper scissors action game.

## Requirements

[LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org) (tested with v11.3)

## Controls

Player one uses the keyboard

- arrow left and right: move left or right
- arrow up: jump
- A: rock
- S: paper
- X: scissors

Other players can join in by just plugging in a USB controller. I put no player
limit on the game, so I don't know if there is one.

- dpad: move left or right
- button 1: jump
- button 2: attack

If you are attacked, you can counter using the correct attack according to
classig rock, paper scissors rules. If you counter attack correctly in time,
you kill the other player, otherwise the attacker kills you.

Last player standing wins.
